## Jekyll Post Creator


Hey! I just wanted to share a Visual Studio Code plugin that I created.

This plugin helps you create new Jekyll posts pretty easily inside of vscode. Here's how to use it:

1. Open the command palette in VS Code with `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
2. Select the option `Jekyll: Create New Post`.
3. A webview window will open in a new tab with input options for the frontmatter of your Jekyll post.
4. Fill in the necessary details and click the `Create Post` button.
5. The post file will be generated in either the `_posts` folder or a custom folder of your choice.

Here's an example of the tool in action:

The tool is open source and can be found on my GitHub: [Jekyll Post Creator](https://github.com/nativvstudios/jekyll-post-creator)
