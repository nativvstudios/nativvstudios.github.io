Well, another year’s gone. _Poof_—and it’s done.

On the development side, I’ve done more than I have in a long time, and it feels good to be contributing to my own projects again. I still don’t get a huge amount of time to work, but when I do sit down and focus, I’ve been able to make steady progress. Due to my current job being rather labour intensive and long I don't have the time that I would like to have but I am happy with the progress I've had this year. 

## What I worked on this year

## nUtilities

This year I spent most of my time improving my Unity editor tools. I now have four tools packaged together under [nUtilities](https://github.com/nativvstudios/com.nutilities.editor):

- HierarchyOrganizer
    
- SceneOrganizer
    
- Favourites
    
- nSearch
    

Together they’ve made my Unity workflow more organized and a lot easier to manage. I’ve released the whole package for free on [GitHub](https://github.com/nativvstudios/com.nutilities.editor).

## What the tools do

**HierarchyOrganizer** lets you create colored separators in the Unity hierarchy.

**SceneOrganizer** is a scene management tool. It lets you group scenes for organization, leave notes on scenes, and create scenes.

**Favourites** is a window where you can drag files from the Project window and pin frequently-used items. You can group files, and notes from SceneOrganizer are shared between Favourites and SceneOrganizer.

**nSearch** is a “Spotlight”-style search tool for Unity. With a hotkey (Ctrl + Shift + Space), it opens a search window that can find items in your project and hierarchy.

There are other small features as well, but those are the main ones.

## From Ether

I’m also working on an RPG called “From Ether”. It’s a project I’ve been on (on and off) for years under a few names (“Ranger”, “Rangers of the Realm”, etc.). I’m not trying to overpromise anything, but I’m happy with the direction it’s going.

## Tiled rules generator extension

Another thing I built this year was a tool for [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/). It’s a plugin that helps generate rules files for automapping tiles. You can find it here: [https://github.com/nativvstudios/tiled-rules-gen-ext](https://github.com/nativvstudios/tiled-rules-gen-ext)

## Jekyll post creator (VS Code)

I also made a small VS Code extension to generate Jekyll post files: [https://github.com/nativvstudios/jekyll-post-creator](https://github.com/nativvstudios/jekyll-post-creator)

## PlacesNB

Lastly, I worked on this website: [PlacesNB](https://www.placesnb.ca/). The goal is to make it a good resource for finding places to visit around New Brunswick. I'd like to take this further, but we'll see what happens!

That covers my progress for the year. I’m glad I made time for it, and I’m hoping to stay consistent going into 2026.

Thanks for reading,
