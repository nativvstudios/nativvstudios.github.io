Well that was quick!

Just like that, 2022 is nothing but a memory. Well, in 5 days that is. But now that this year is done and over with I wanted to sit and write about what I did with Nativv Studios this year, I wish I did a lot more but life just gets in the way sometimes. 
Here we go!

So to begin with, I released two Jekyll themes one called [JekyllxBulma](https://nativvstudios.com/jekyllxbulma) and the other a Bootstrap theme which you can see [here](https://www.nativvstudios.com/bootstrap-jekyll-dark/).
I've added a bunch of stuff to this site the most notible being the [Links](https://nativvstudios.com/links) page, The [Life](https://nativvstudios.com/life) section which I plan to be a little "database" of mindful tips and showcasing the top podasts I listen to and Another cool thing added was the [Portfolio](https://nativvstudios.com/portfolio) section, I think it's cool because all I need to do is add in a few lines of text in my Jekyll config and it pops out a nice looking card!
I've also made one [tutorial](https://nativvstudios.com/posts/unity-news-info-box/) on how to made a news bulletin in Unity.

So looking back I really haven't done as much as I wanted to this year, not by a long shot. I wanted to write a lot more tutorials and I wanted to make a lot more Jekyll themes. 
Now this coming new year, I do plan to make more of both but I'm going to stop with this invisible deadlines that I give to my self. I'm going to start writing everything down, taking more notes, reading more books to give Ideas about posts and tutorials. I want to really showcase what I can really do this year. I don't want to be stuck doing labourer work the rest of my life, I know I can do this.

So, goodbye 2022 and Hello 2023!
